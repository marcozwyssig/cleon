for purposes that may include providing you with additional information,
features and functionality. The following provisions apply to
all automatic Internet connections by the Software:
13.1.1 When the Software automatically connects to the Internet,
an Internet protocol address (“IP Address”) that is associated
with your current Internet connection is sent to an cleon.architecturemethods.org42
website;
13.1.2 When the Software automatically connects to the Internet,
no personally identifiable information is sent except to the
extent that IP Addresses may be considered personally identifiable
in some jurisdictions; and
13.1.3 Whenever the Software makes an Internet connection and
communicates with an cleon.architecturemethods.org42 website, unless you are provided
with separate terms of use at that time, the cleon.architecturemethods.org42.com
Terms of Use (http://www.cleon.architecturemethods.org42.com) shall apply. Please
note that the cleon.architecturemethods.org42 Privacy Policy allows tracking of website
visits and it addresses in detail the topic of tracking and use
of cookies, web beacons and similar devices.
13.1.4 The Software may transmit your serial number and your
e-mail address you used to register your license to cleon.architecturemethods.org42
and in doing so may prevent uses of the Software that are not
permitted.
13.2 Updating. The Software may cause your Computer to automatically

certificate.
14. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.
This section sets forth specific provisions related to certain
products and components of the Software as well as limited exceptions

in this agreement, this section will supersede such other term
or condition.

14.1.1 This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights
of any party, including those dealing as consumers. For example,
for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software for personal,
domestic or household use (not business purposes), this agreement
is subject to the Consumer Guarantees Act.
14.1.2 If you obtained the Software in the European Union (EU),
you usually reside in the EU and you are a consumer (that is
you use the Software for personal, non-business related purposes),
then Section 6 does not apply to your purchase and use of the
Software. Instead, cleon.architecturemethods.org42 warrants for a period of 2 years
from purchase that the Software provides the functionalities
set forth in the Documentation (the “agreed upon functionalities”)
when used on the recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial
variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish
any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE
THAT YOU REQUEST TO USE ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, PRODUCT
SAMPLER BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS
OR TO THE EXTENT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS
BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To make a warranty claim, you must notify
cleon.architecturemethods.org42 during this 2 year period, providing details of proof
of purchase of the Software. cleon.architecturemethods.org42 will verify with you
whether there is a defect in the Software or advise you that
the error arises because you have not installed the Software
correctly (in which case, cleon.architecturemethods.org42 shall assist you). If there
is a defect in the Software, you may request from cleon.architecturemethods.org42
either a refund or a repaired/replacement copy of the Software.
Requests must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event
your warranty details are substantiated, cleon.architecturemethods.org42 will meet
your request for repaired/replacement Software, unless it is
not reasonable for cleon.architecturemethods.org42 to do so, in which case cleon.architecturemethods.org42
will provide you with a refund. For warranty assistance, please
contact cleon.architecturemethods.org42.
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability)
will continue to apply to any damages claims you make in respect
of your use of the Software. Nonetheless, cleon.architecturemethods.org42 shall be
liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the
event of a breach by cleon.architecturemethods.org42 of this agreement. You are advised
to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages,
in particular by making back-up copies of the Software and your
computer data.
This agreement, and in particular, this Section 14.1.2, is intended
to describe your rights (including your statutory rights) in
the event there should be problems with your use of the Software.
If your statutory rights should be greater than this description,
your statutory rights shall apply.
14.2 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is
pre-commercial release or beta software (“Pre-release Software”),
then this section applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release
version, does not represent final product from cleon.architecturemethods.org42, and
may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause
system or other failures and data loss. cleon.architecturemethods.org42 may never
commercially release the Pre-release Software. If you received
the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement
your use of the Software is also governed by such agreement.
You will return or destroy all copies of Pre-release Software
upon request by cleon.architecturemethods.org42 or upon cleon.architecturemethods.org42’s commercial
release of such Software. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS
AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS
AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
