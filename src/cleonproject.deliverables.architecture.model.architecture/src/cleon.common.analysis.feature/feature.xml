14.1.1 This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights
of any party, including those dealing as consumers. For example,

domestic or household use (not business purposes), this agreement
is subject to the Consumer Guarantees Act.
14.1.2 If you obtained the Software in the European Union (EU),

then Section 6 does not apply to your purchase and use of the
Software. Instead, cleon.common.analysis warrants for a period of 2 years
from purchase that the Software provides the functionalities
set forth in the Documentation (the “agreed upon functionalities”)
when used on the recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial
variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish
any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE
THAT YOU REQUEST TO USE ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, PRODUCT
SAMPLER BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS
OR TO THE EXTENT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS
BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To make a warranty claim, you must notify
cleon.common.analysis during this 2 year period, providing details of proof
of purchase of the Software. cleon.common.analysis will verify with you
whether there is a defect in the Software or advise you that
the error arises because you have not installed the Software
correctly (in which case, cleon.common.analysis shall assist you). If there
is a defect in the Software, you may request from cleon.common.analysis
either a refund or a repaired/replacement copy of the Software.
Requests must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event
your warranty details are substantiated, cleon.common.analysis will meet
your request for repaired/replacement Software, unless it is
not reasonable for cleon.common.analysis to do so, in which case cleon.common.analysis
will provide you with a refund. For warranty assistance, please
contact cleon.common.analysis.
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability)
will continue to apply to any damages claims you make in respect
of your use of the Software. Nonetheless, cleon.common.analysis shall be
liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the
event of a breach by cleon.common.analysis of this agreement. You are advised
to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages,
in particular by making back-up copies of the Software and your
computer data.
This agreement, and in particular, this Section 14.1.2, is intended
to describe your rights (including your statutory rights) in
the event there should be problems with your use of the Software.
If your statutory rights should be greater than this description,
your statutory rights shall apply.

pre-commercial release or beta software (“Pre-release Software”),
then this section applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre-release
version, does not represent final product from cleon.common.analysis, and
may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause
system or other failures and data loss. cleon.common.analysis may never
commercially release the Pre-release Software. If you received
the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement

upon request by cleon.common.analysis or upon cleon.common.analysis’s commercial
release of such Software. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS

AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
